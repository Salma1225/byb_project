# byb_project

## Overview
This repository is part of a practical task for learning basic Git and GitHub operations. It includes a simple Python script that prints a message to the terminal.

## Project Description
The project involves creating a Python script named `helloWorld.py` that initially prints "Hello World!" to the terminal. After tracking and staging the file using Git, the script was modified to print "Git is Awesome!" instead. These changes were then staged, committed, and pushed to this GitHub repository.

## Installation

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the project directory:
